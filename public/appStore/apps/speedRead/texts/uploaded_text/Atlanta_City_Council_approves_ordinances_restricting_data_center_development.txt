- The Atlanta City Council has approved two new ordinances aimed 
at defining and regulating data centers within the city. The first 
ordinance officially defines what constitutes a "data center," 
while the second limits where these facilities can be built.Data 
centers, large warehouses filled with computer servers that store, 
manage, and transmit digital data, have become essential to internet 
operations. However, they are also large and noisy, prompting 
concerns from residents and city officials about their impact 
on certain areas of the city.The newly approved ordinances will 
prohibit the construction of data centers along the Beltline trail 
loop and within a half-mile of transit centers, including MARTA 
and bus stops. These measures come in response to the rapid growth 
of data centers in Atlanta, which has seen a 211% increase in 
development since 2023, the fastest rate of growth in the country.Councilmember 
Jason Dozier, one of the ordinance's sponsors, emphasized 
the importance of having controls in place to ensure the 
best outcomes for Atlanta’s communities. Fellow sponsor, Councilmember 
Matt Westmoreland, echoed this sentiment, stating that the 
city is committed to ensuring Atlanta's growth is balanced, sustainable, 
and focused on residents' well-being.Existing data centers 
in the city will not be affected by the new regulations, though 
they may face restrictions on future expansion.All the news you
