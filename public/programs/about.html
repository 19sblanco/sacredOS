    About Sacred OS
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Intro
  </h2>
  <p>
    Sacred OS is an operating system that runs in your web browser and is written in vanilla JavaScript, which
    might actually be the first of it's kind. Sacred OS uses a bootloader so you can use the OS with your saved
    settings, programs, files, etc. Sacred OS is inspired by operating systems from the Windows 9x era. It is
    open source, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/M-Valentino/sacredOS">
      the code can be found here</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>
    How it works
  </h2>
  <p>
    Sacred OS runs off a JavaScript object which is essentially the "hard disk". The GUI, the kernal, programs,
    and more are all stored here. The bootloader writes to this object either by uploading a disk backup or by
    fetching all the necessary files and storing them (what happens when you boot from a fresh install). Sacred
    OS and the bootloader uses a file table so that they can properly index files (like NTFS or ext4).
  </p>
  <p>
    In Sacred OS, HTML files are executable. When you execute an HTML file, it is loaded into a window which
    contains an iframe of the HTML file. These HTML files can communicate with the kernel, such as requesting
    the system's main style sheet or writing to the disk.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Current State
  </h2>
  <p>
    File creation is limited at the moment in Sacred OS. Right now you can only create txt files and create
    one new file per directory. You can delete files, but you can't delete folders. Eventually you will be
    able to edit HTML files. Right now clicking on HTML files in the file explorer just executes them in a
    window.
